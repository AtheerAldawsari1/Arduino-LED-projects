# Arduino-LED-project

This repository contains two tasks that I completed as part of my Electric Power and Electronics path in Smart Methods . The first task involves lighting up a single LED, while the second task involves creating a LED matrix.

## Task 1: LED Blink

The LED blink task involves lighting up a single LED on an Arduino board. To complete this task, you will need the following materials:

- Arduino board
- LED
- Resistor
- Bush button 
- breadboard
- Jumper wires
